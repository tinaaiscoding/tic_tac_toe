This is my first project! \
Enjoy my take on the classic tic-tac-toe game.

**How to play:**
- The game requires two players. 
- Each player will be assigned a token.
- There is a 3x3 grid in which each player takes turn putting their token in a square.
- The first player to get three tokens in a row (vertically, horizontally *or* diagonally) wins!

 ## 🙆🏻‍♀️ Comments from Tina
 Super happy with the way everything turned out. I had **so** much fun building this project. I would literally laugh and celebrate when something worked the way I wanted it to. I think it was the Super Mario theme that made it more fun and enjoyable 🤣 \
 \
 By the end of this project, I found that I was able to debug A LOT faster then previously. 90% of the time, I knew exactly where I should look and what I needed to change.
